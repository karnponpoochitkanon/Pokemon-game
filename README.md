### 🎮 Game Concept Summary

You are a Pokemon trainer who starts with Pikachu.  
Explore the world, walk into grass zones to encounter wild Pokemon, and catch them into your team.  
Your goal is to build a strong team and (in the future) defeat the Final Gym Boss (YIM) in a 3v3 battle!

> 🧪 **Note**: The final boss battle system (YIM) is still under development in this version.
